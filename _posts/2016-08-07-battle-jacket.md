summary: DIY Heavy Metal Battle Jacket!
---

## Initial Work (Aug 6)
Last May, I attended a Lamb of God concert at the House of Blues Boston. It was an intense experience, and now I'm eagerly anticipating a few more metal shows coming up over the next several months. In preparation for these, I decided to create my own [battle vest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-off) in order to rep my favorite bands. 

I started off with a huge denim jacket from a local thrift store and a pair of scissors and got to work. 

First came removing the decidedly not-so-metal parts of the jacket: the colorful fleece liner on the inside, and the rope clasps on the outside. Next came the hood and sleeves, making this into a stylish vest that can be worn over your favorite black t-shirt. It's not as noticeable here, but I also had to cut off a good portion of the bottom of the jacket to make the length a little more reasonable.

And now I have a beautiful blank denim canvas! Next up, patches...
