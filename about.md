Hi! My name is Noah, and I'm a student in the MIT class of 2020. I'm passionate about making things of all sorts, and I'll be using this blog to document my projects from here on out. If you'd like to keep up-to-date with my activities, be sure to follow me on Twitter [@noahmoroze](https://twitter.com/noahmoroze). If you'd like to reach out to me directly with questions or comments you can email me at [moroze@mit.edu](mailto:moroze@mit.edu).
